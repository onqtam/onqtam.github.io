Hello! I'm Viktor Kirilov and I'm a C++ developer from Bulgaria. I've set out to build a game development studio for games I'm passionate about. I don't plan on doing this alone - more on that in future posts.

<br /><br />

I'll write about gamedev, programming, entrepreneurship, motivation, books, fitness, swimming, health, and a bunch of other things.

<br /><br />

Initially you can expect a somewhat low frequency of posts - like once a month - with updates on my projects or just thoughts on whatever I see important enough to share.

<br /><br />

These posts can shed some more light about me:
