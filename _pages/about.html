I'll write about gamedev, programming, entrepreneurship, motivation, books, fitness, swimming, health, and a bunch of other things.

<br /><br />

I would imagine that I blog about something once a month - with updates on my projects or just thoughts on whatever I see as important for me to share.

<br /><br />

A few posts can shed some more light about me:

      my first post here
    </a>
